User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project.
I have created a photography website using everthing I have learnt so far -HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP.

UX




The 'portfolio' section is created using lightbox. I followed a Youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-RtYiiB47E) to achieve this. All the images are this website are taken by Rachel herself.
