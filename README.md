# UX 

User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project.
I have created a photography website using everthing I have learnt so far -HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP.

# Features of the Website 
The website consistes of 4 sections-Home, About, Portfolio and Contact. These are all fixed to the Navigation on the right side. When the user clicks on one of these tabs the website will scroll to that section.

The layout of the website was created using Bootstrap's grid system and styled by CSS.

Navigation:
Created using Bootstrap to make it responsive. This fixed Navigationis transparent and sits ontop of the hero image.

Home:
Landing page contains a hero image of one of the client's work.

About:
Contains an image of the client and a brief description of who the client is and what she offers.

Portfolio:
Created using Bootstrap grid system and lightbox gallery to display some of the clients work.

Contact:
Created using Bootstrap form to make it responsive with the following features-Name, Number, Email, Date of Event, Type of Event, Text area and Submit button.

Footer:
Contains the clients social media pages, when clicked the user is brought to the clients social media page in a new tab.
