# Testing 

W3C Markup Validaion - Used to validate HTML & CSS code. <br>

Google Chrome developer - Used to check that my website was responsive on all devices.

<strong>Contact Form</strong>:
If the user clicks 'submit' without submitting any data an error message should appear that hightligts the required field to be filled.

If the user does not fill in a valid email address, an error message will appear.

If the user does not fill in the 'Name' or 'Event Type', an error message will appear.

Ensured that when the user clicks on the social media link that the link works and will open the social media
page in a new tab to the clients account.


# Bugs
* **Bug** - Getting the font color/background color for the navigation so it was visible above the hero image. Most font colors faded into the hero image.
* **Fix** - color code #f16c6b and #00BFFF works best for the navigation with a transparent backgrounf.
