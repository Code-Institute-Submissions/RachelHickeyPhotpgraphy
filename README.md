# RACHEL HICKEY PHOTOGRAPHY

User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project.
I have created a photography website using everthing I have learnt so far -HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP.

UX

This website is created for Rachel's potential clients and provides them with a brief overview of who Rachel is, what she offers, examples of her work and access to her social media content.

please see link to wireframe.


The 'portfolio' section is created using lightbox. I followed a Youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-RtYiiB47E) to achieve this. All the images are this website are taken by Rachel herself.
